# Black Hole M87 Simulation

This project is a simulation of the bending of light around the black hole M87. It showcases the phenomenon of gravitational lensing using a visual representation.

## Description

The Black Hole M87 Simulation is a Python program that uses the Pygame library to create an interactive visualization of light bending around the black hole M87. Gravitational lensing is a gravitational phenomenon where light paths are curved by the gravitational field of massive objects. This simulation provides a visual representation of how light trajectories are distorted near a massive object like a black hole. I have used certain formulas which account for General Relativity.

## Features

- Visual representation of the black hole M87
- Simulation of light particles being bent by the gravitational pull of the black hole
- Real-time rendering of the simulation using Pygame
